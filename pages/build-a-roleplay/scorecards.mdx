## Scorecard Structure

- Scorecards are a list of **criteria and metrics** that add up to 100%
- A **criteria** is an AI prompt that analyzes the roleplay transcript to provide a score
- A **metric** measures paraverbal metrics like word speed, filler words, with special analysis tools
- Both criteria and metrics **can be re-used** across multiple scorecards

<Tip>
  Every new company comes with 100 pre-built criteria

## Building a Scorecard

You have three options to build a roleplay:
- **Build from scratch** - Self-select your own criteria and metrics
- **Start with a template** - Use one of our pre-built scorecards
- **Build with AI** - Use AI to generate new criteria from a text prompt

## Editing a Scorecard

Once your scorecard is made, you can add, edit, and remove criteria and metrics to improve scorecard reliability and accuracy.

### Adding Criteria

You can add criteria and metrics with the "+/- criteria" and "+/- metrics" options at the bottom of the scorecard.

### Creating New Criteria

There are a couple core parts to the criteria: the criteria title, folder, question type, and prompt.

The question types ordered according to most commonly used include:

- **Yes/No Questions**: Simple binary evaluation
- **Compound Questions**: Combination of multiple yes/no criteria
- **Range Questions**: Score on a scale of 1-10
- **Open-ended Questions**: For gathering general feedback

Here are a couple tips for writing reliable and accurate criteria:

1. **Use the AI generator** to the right of the "Prompt" field to help with generation
2. **Avoid general statements** like "speak with confidence," "ask good questions," etc.
3. **Be hyper-specific** in what you are looking for
4. **Provide passing examples** to help the AI understand

The general structure for a well built criteria is:

- "Did the rep... [SPECIFIC ACTION]? For example, did they say something along the lines of [DIRECT QUOTE]"

### Removing and Adjusting Criteria Weights

- You can remove criteria with the red trashcan icon when you hover over the criteria
- You can adjust the criteria weights by changing the number next to the title of the criteria

<Tip>
  Use the "Distribute Weights" button to automatically balance the scoring criteria evenly.
