## Key Terms vs. Pronunciations: What's the Difference?

Our platform offers two powerful tools to enhance your roleplay experience:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="🎯 Key Terms" icon="microphone" >
    <b>Help the AI UNDERSTAND what you're saying</b>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Better speech-to-text recognition</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Adding "BDC" as a key term so it's heard as "BDC" instead of "B D C"</p>
    <p><strong>When to use:</strong> When certain words get misunderstood or transcribed incorrectly</p>
</Card>

<Card title="🗣️ Pronunciations" icon="volume-high" >
    <b>Help the AI SPEAK words correctly</b>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Better text-to-speech pronunciation</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Setting "KLIM" to be pronounced as "climb" instead of "klim"</p>
    <p><strong>When to use:</strong> When you want the AI to say words differently than their default pronunciation</p>
</Card>

# Key Terms Guide

## What are Key Terms?

Key Terms are industry-specific words, product names, or specialized vocabulary that you want our speech recognition system to understand accurately during roleplays. By adding these terms, you can significantly improve how well the system recognizes important words in your conversations.

## Why Use Key Terms?

Have you ever noticed that certain words get misunderstood during roleplays? For example:

- "Rider" being heard as "writer"
- "BDC" being heard as "B D C" (letter by letter)
- "CRM" being heard as "see are em"

Key Terms help solve these problems by telling our speech recognition system to pay special attention to these important words.

## Where to Set Key Terms

### Company-Level Key Terms

**Location:** Company Settings → Advanced → Key Terms

Company-level key terms apply to **all roleplays** within your company. These are perfect for:

- Industry-specific terminology
- Product names
- Company-specific acronyms
- Common customer names or brands

**Example:** If you're in the automotive industry, you might add terms like "Rider," "BDC," "F&I," "VIN," etc.

### Roleplay-Specific Key Terms

**Location:** Roleplay Settings → Additional Settings → Speech Recognition

Roleplay-specific key terms are additional terms that apply only to that particular roleplay. These are great for:

- Scenario-specific vocabulary
- Customer names used in that roleplay
- Product models or features relevant to that conversation

**Example:** For a specific roleplay about selling a particular car model, you might add "Camry," "Hybrid," "Certified Pre-Owned," etc.

## How Key Terms Work Together

When you start a roleplay, the system automatically combines:

1. **Company key terms** (applied to all roleplays)
2. **Roleplay-specific key terms** (only for that roleplay)
3. **User and company names** (automatically included)

This ensures you get the best possible speech recognition for each conversation.

## Key Terms Best Practices

### What to Add

- **Industry jargon** that might be misunderstood
- **Product names** and model numbers
- **Company acronyms** (BDC, CRM, F&I, etc.)
- **Customer names** or brands mentioned frequently
- **Technical terms** specific to your business

### What NOT to Add

- Common everyday words (the system already knows these)
- Very long phrases (stick to individual words or short phrases)
- Duplicate terms (the system automatically removes duplicates)

### Tips for Success

- **Be specific:** Add "Rider" instead of "rider insurance"
- **Use proper capitalization:** "BDC" instead of "bdc"
- **Keep it relevant:** Focus on terms that actually appear in your roleplays

# Pronunciation Guide: Teaching the AI How to Say Your Words

## What Are Pronunciations?

Pronunciations help you teach the AI how to correctly say specific words, terms, or company names during roleplays. This is especially useful for:

- **Company names** (e.g., "Acme" should sound like "ACK-mee")
- **Industry jargon** (e.g., "API" should sound like "ay-pee-eye")
- **Proper names** (e.g., "MySQL" should sound like "my-sequel")
- **Acronyms and abbreviations**

## How It Works

When you add pronunciations, the AI will automatically replace the original word with your preferred pronunciation during roleplays. The AI reads the text exactly as you've written it, so you can use:

- **Phonetic spelling** (e.g., "fown-ET-ik" for "phonetic")
- **Spelled out letters** (e.g., "ay-pee-eye" for "API")
- **Alternative spellings** (e.g., "ACK-mee Corp" for "Acme Corp")

## Where to Find Pronunciation Settings

### Company-Wide Pronunciations
These apply to all roleplays in your company:

1. **Go to Manager Portal** - Click the "Manager Portal" button in your main navigation
2. **Open Company Settings** - Click on the "Company Settings" tab
3. **Scroll to Pronunciations** - Find the "Company Pronunciations" section
4. **Add your pronunciations** - These will be used in all company roleplays

### Roleplay-Specific Pronunciations
These only apply to one specific roleplay:

1. **Edit a Roleplay** - Go to your roleplay and click "Edit Settings"
2. **Open Advanced Settings** - Click "Additional Settings" or look for advanced options
3. **Find Roleplay Pronunciations** - Look for the "Roleplay Pronunciations" section
4. **Add roleplay-specific pronunciations** - These will override company-wide ones

## Understanding the Terms

### Canonical
- **What it means**: The original word as it appears in your scripts or text
- **Examples**: "KLIM", "API", "Acme Corp", "MySQL"
- **Tip**: Enter this exactly as it appears in your roleplay content

### Alias
- **What it means**: How you want the AI to pronounce the word
- **Examples**: "climb", "ay-pee-eye", "ACK-mee Corp", "my-sequel"
- **Tip**: Write this phonetically - exactly how it should sound

### Examples of Good Pronunciations

| Original Word (Canonical) | Pronunciation (Alias) | Why This Works |
|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| API | ay-pee-eye | Letters spelled out |
| Acme Corp | ACK-mee Corp | Phonetic with normal words |
| MySQL | my-sequel | Common pronunciation |
| iOS | eye-oh-ess | Letters spelled out clearly |

### Tips for Better Pronunciations

- **Use common words** when possible (e.g., "climb" instead of "klym")
- **Spell out letters clearly** (e.g., "ay-bee-see" not "abc")
- **Include spaces** in multi-word pronunciations
- **Test different approaches** if the first attempt doesn't sound right
- **Keep it simple** - the AI reads exactly what you write

## Company vs. Roleplay Pronunciations

### Company-Wide Pronunciations
- **Apply everywhere** - Used in all roleplays across your company
- **Best for**: Company names, common industry terms, product names
- **Who can edit**: Manager portal users with company settings access
- **Shown as**: Regular editable fields

### Roleplay-Specific Pronunciations
- **Apply to one roleplay** - Only used in that specific roleplay
- **Best for**: Customer names, scenario-specific terms, roleplay context
- **Who can edit**: Anyone who can edit that roleplay
- **Override company settings** - If the same word exists in both, roleplay wins

### Inherited Pronunciations
When editing roleplay pronunciations, you'll see:
- **Gray/dimmed entries** - These come from your company settings
- **Cannot be edited** - To change these, go to company settings
- **Helpful tooltip** - Hover over gray entries for instructions

## Pronunciation Best Practices

### What to Include
- **Company and product names** that are often mispronounced
- **Industry-specific acronyms** (API, CRM, ROI, etc.)
- **Technical terms** specific to your business
- **Customer or competitor names** mentioned in roleplays

### What to Avoid
- **Common English words** - The AI usually pronounces these correctly
- **Very obvious pronunciations** - Don't add unless there's a real issue
- **Too many variations** - Stick to the most important terms

### Organization Tips
- **Start with company-wide** - Add the most common terms at the company level
- **Use roleplay-specific sparingly** - Only for terms unique to that scenario
- **Keep it consistent** - Use the same pronunciation approach across similar words
- **Test and refine** - Listen to roleplays and adjust as needed

## Pronunciation Troubleshooting

### The AI Still Mispronounces My Word
- **Check spelling** - Make sure the "Canonical" matches exactly what's in your content
- **Try different approaches** - Experiment with phonetic spelling variations
- **Use simpler words** - Break complex pronunciations into simpler parts
- **Add spaces** - Sometimes spacing helps with multi-syllable words

## Getting Started with Key Terms and Pronunciations

1. **Start with company-wide settings:** Add the most common industry-specific words and pronunciations your team uses
2. **Test with a roleplay:** Create a roleplay and add any scenario-specific terms or pronunciations
3. **Monitor results:** Pay attention to how well the system recognizes your key terms and pronounces your custom words
4. **Refine over time:** Add or remove terms and pronunciations based on your experience

## Seeing Your Settings in Action

When you start a roleplay, the system automatically uses all relevant key terms to improve speech recognition and applies all pronunciations to make the AI sound more natural. You don't need to do anything special - just start your roleplay as usual!

### What You'll Notice

- Better recognition of industry-specific terms (from key terms)
- More accurate transcription of product names (from key terms)
- Improved understanding of company acronyms (from key terms)
- Natural pronunciation of company and product names (from pronunciations)
- Professional-sounding AI speech (from pronunciations)

## Getting Help

If you're having trouble with key terms or pronunciations:

1. **Test with simple examples first** - Start with obvious examples to learn the system
2. **Ask your team** - Other users might have good strategies
3. **Contact support** - Include specific examples of words that aren't working
4. **Share successful patterns** - Help your team by documenting what works

Remember: Key terms and pronunciations are powerful tools to make your roleplays more accurate, professional, and effective. Start with your most important terms and build from there!
