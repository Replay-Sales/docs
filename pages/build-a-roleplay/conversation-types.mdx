## Conversation Type Components

### 1. Title

A title that describes the scenario.

### 2. AI Bot's perspective when the conversation starts

**Definition:** Gives the AI relevant context about its previous interactions with the user before the roleplay begins.

**Style:** Should include the physical setting the conversation takes place, role of the user, summary of prior knowledge, and immediate context of the conversation. Follow this three-sentence structure for optimal readability.

- **Sentence 1:** The physical setting where the conversation takes place and role of the user: "You are in/at [Phone Call/Video Call/At your house/At your office/Etc] with a [Sales rep/customer service rep/technician/manager/etc.]."
- **Sentence 2:** A 1-sentence summary of prior knowledge the AI would have about the user, the prior topics discussed, or any other relevant context. *Do not include if the AI and user would have never interacted before the start of this roleplay*
- **Sentence 3:** Immediate context of what happened or would have been discussed right before the roleplay starts. Typically in the format of "The conversation starts after..."

<Warning>
  Do not include any specific information about the persona's pains, needs, wants, objections, or personal situation. This information belongs under the persona.
</Warning>

**Examples:**

- "You agreed hop on a zoom with a rep from a company. After a brief cold call, you told them you are open to schedule a meeting to learn more about what they do. The conversation starts as both of you enter the virtual call."
- "You agreed to a meet with a rep from a company about their product. The meeting started five minutes ago and you've been making small talk with the rep. The conversation starts after you agreed to answer some questions about why you agreed to the meeting."
- "You're meeting with a rep from a company about their product. They have explained the product and it's pricing to you. You've already been explained the entire offer and don't need any more case studies or examples."
- "You agreed hop on a zoom with a rep from a company. You open to learning more about what they do. The conversation starts after the rep has explained their product to you for the last 20 minutes."
- "You agreed to meet with a rep from a company about their product. The meeting started a couple minutes ago and you asked the rep to explain their product to you."
- "You've had some conversations with a sales rep. You are talking with them about using their product/service."
- "You just had someone do an inspection for you. The conversation starts as the rep comes back to you to review the inspection with you."
- "You agreed hop on a zoom with a rep from a company. You open to learning more about what they do. The conversation starts after you've been making small talk for the last couple minutes."
- "You answered an unexpected call from a random number. The conversation starts as you answer the phone."
- "You were at home when you got an unexpected knock at your door. You walked to the door to open it and noticed the person at your door is wearing a uniform and holding an ipad."
- "You recently filled out a form that gave your contact information to a company. You received a phone call from an unknown number and answered the phone."

### 3. Conversation-specific instructions for the AI

The rules of engagement of this type of conversation. These are conversation-specific instructions for how the AI should behave in this type of conversation. NOTE: These instructions will apply to every AI persona that is used for this conversation type.

### 4. Conversation starter

**Definition:** The line the AI uses to open the conversation. The conversation starter is important because users don't always read the roleplay instructions before they start the roleplay.

**Style:** The conversation starter should hint at 1) what was happening right before the conversation started and 2) what they should talk about next. Follow this two sentence structure for easiest understandability:

- **Sentence 1:** What most recently happened in the interaction
- **Sentence 2:** What should be talked about next

**Examples:**

- "Hi, nice to meet you" (For the first time the customer meets the rep)
- "Yeah, sure I'm happy to start by answering some questions."
- "Yep, the offer and pricing makes sense. Thanks for explaining that to me. I need to think about it before moving forward." (For an objection handling roleplay at the end of a sales conversation)
- "Yeah, that all makes sense. Thanks for explaining your product to me. How does pricing work?" (For explaining pricing during a sales conversation)
- "Thanks for doing the inspection. How did it go?"

### 5. Opening sound

**Definition:** You have the option to select a starting sound for the conversation. This is a sound that is played before the AI says the conversation starter.

**Options:** Opening sound options include:

- **Outbound phone** - User making a call to the AI (most commonly used for a cold call roleplay)
- **Inbound phone** - AI making a call to the user (most commonly used for a customer service roleplay)
- **Door knock** - User knocks on the AI's door (most commonly used for home services or door to door sales)
