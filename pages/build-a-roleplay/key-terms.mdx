## What are Key Terms?

Key Terms are industry-specific words, product names, or specialized vocabulary that you want our speech recognition system to understand accurately during roleplays. By adding these terms, you can significantly improve how well the system recognizes important words in your conversations.

## Why Use Key Terms?

Have you ever noticed that certain words get misunderstood during roleplays? For example:

- "Rider" being heard as "writer"
- "BDC" being heard as "B D C" (letter by letter)
- "CRM" being heard as "see are em"

Key Terms help solve these problems by telling our speech recognition system to pay special attention to these important words.

## Where to Set Key Terms

### Company-Level Key Terms

**Location:** Company Settings → Advanced → Key Terms

Company-level key terms apply to **all roleplays** within your company. These are perfect for:

- Industry-specific terminology
- Product names
- Company-specific acronyms
- Common customer names or brands

**Example:** If you're in the automotive industry, you might add terms like "Rider," "BDC," "F&I," "VIN," etc.

### Roleplay-Specific Key Terms

**Location:** Roleplay Settings → Additional Settings → Speech Recognition

Roleplay-specific key terms are additional terms that apply only to that particular roleplay. These are great for:

- Scenario-specific vocabulary
- Customer names used in that roleplay
- Product models or features relevant to that conversation

**Example:** For a specific roleplay about selling a particular car model, you might add "Camry," "Hybrid," "Certified Pre-Owned," etc.

## How Key Terms Work Together

When you start a roleplay, the system automatically combines:

1. **Company key terms** (applied to all roleplays)
2. **Roleplay-specific key terms** (only for that roleplay)
3. **User and company names** (automatically included)

This ensures you get the best possible speech recognition for each conversation.

## Best Practices

### What to Add

- **Industry jargon** that might be misunderstood
- **Product names** and model numbers
- **Company acronyms** (BDC, CRM, F&I, etc.)
- **Customer names** or brands mentioned frequently
- **Technical terms** specific to your business

### What NOT to Add

- Common everyday words (the system already knows these)
- Very long phrases (stick to individual words or short phrases)
- Duplicate terms (the system automatically removes duplicates)

### Tips for Success

- **Be specific:** Add "Rider" instead of "rider insurance"
- **Use proper capitalization:** "BDC" instead of "bdc"
- **Add variations:** If you use both "CRM" and "Customer Relationship Management," add both
- **Keep it relevant:** Focus on terms that actually appear in your roleplays

## Managing Your Key Terms

### Adding Terms

1. Navigate to the appropriate settings page
2. Click the "+" button or type in the input field
3. Type your term and press Enter
4. The term will appear as a tag

### Removing Terms

- Click the "×" on any tag to remove it
- Company terms cannot be removed from roleplay settings (they're inherited)

### Limits

- **Company terms:** Up to 50 terms
- **Roleplay terms:** Up to 50 terms (in addition to company terms)

## Seeing Your Terms in Action

When you start a roleplay, the system automatically uses all relevant key terms to improve speech recognition. You don't need to do anything special - just start your roleplay as usual!

### What You'll Notice

- Better recognition of industry-specific terms
- More accurate transcription of product names
- Improved understanding of company acronyms
- Fewer misunderstandings of important vocabulary

## Troubleshooting

### Terms Not Being Recognized

- Make sure the term is spelled correctly
- Check that you've added it to the right level (company vs. roleplay)
- Ensure the term is actually being used in the conversation
- Try adding common variations of the term

### Too Many Terms

- Focus on the most important terms first
- Remove terms that aren't frequently used
- Consider consolidating similar terms

### Inherited Terms

- Company terms automatically appear in roleplay settings as "inherited" terms
- These are read-only in roleplay settings (you can only edit them in company settings)
- They're clearly marked with a different style to show they're inherited

## Getting Started

1. **Start with company terms:** Add the most common industry-specific words your team uses
2. **Test with a roleplay:** Create a roleplay and add any scenario-specific terms
3. **Monitor results:** Pay attention to how well the system recognizes your key terms
4. **Refine over time:** Add or remove terms based on your experience

Remember, key terms are a powerful tool to make your roleplays more accurate and effective. Start with a few important terms and build from there!
