## Three core building blocks are used to build a roleplay:

1. **Conversation type** - The context of the conversation from the AI's perspective (e.g., cold call, warm call, discovery, presentation, customer service, etc.)
2. **Persona** - AI's name, appearance, voice, and personality style
3. **Scorecard** - Roleplay scoring framework

Once built, these building blocks can be re-used across multiple roleplays.

## Other optional building blocks include:

- **Persona background** - Title/role, concerns, pains, needs, etc.
- **Solution** - The conversation topic or product being sold (often used for teams that sell multiple products like cars)
- **Responses/questions/responses** - Specific phrases you want the AI to say (often used for objections)
