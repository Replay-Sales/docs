## Three key concepts to include in the User Instructions:

1. **Objective** - What you want the AI to do, reveal, or believe by the end of the roleplay
2. **Conversation topic** - What is talked about during the conversation
3. **Relevant context** - Physical setting, previous interaction summary, and immediate conversation context

## Follow this two-sentence format for easiest readability:

- First half of first sentence - Objective
- Second half of first sentence - Conversation topic
- Second sentence - Relevant context

## Examples (sales-specific):

- Build rapport with the prospect before you start the meeting. The conversation starts as you and the prospect make small talk before the meeting starts.
- Reveal the prospect's goals, pain points, and expectations by asking questions. The conversation starts at the beginning of a conversation with a new prospect. You have already built rapport and set the agenda with the prospect.
- Overcome the prospect's objections to close the sale. The conversation starts after you've explained product and pricing to a prospect at the end of a sales call.
- Close the sale after explaining price. The conversation starts after you've done a complete demo of your product to the prospect.
- Show the customer you can solve their needs by presenting your product/service. The conversation starts after the prospect has told you about their needs.
- Ensure the customer meets the criteria by asking qualifying questions. End the conversation after you have effectively qualified the prospect.
- Show the prospect they have problem(s) that need to be fixed by reviewing the inspection with them. The conversation starts after you've completed the inspection and approach the prospect to start the conversation.
- Set the agenda for the meeting before you start asking questions to learn more about the prospect. The conversation starts after you've built rapport with the prospect at the beginning of the meeting.
- Schedule a meeting with the prospect on a cold call. The conversation starts as the prospect answers the phone.
- Convince the customer to move forward after giving your door approach. The conversation starts after the prospect opens the door.
- Get an introduction to the decision maker by getting past the receptionist. The conversation starts as you start your conversation with the receptionist.
- Overcome the prospect's objections to continue the conversation. The conversation starts after you interrupted the prospect's day to pitch them.
- Schedule a meeting with a warm lead. You called a prospect after they recently interacted with the company.
