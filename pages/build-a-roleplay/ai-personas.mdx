There are two main parts of each AI bot: the persona and the background.

## AI Persona

**Overview:** The AI's name, appearance, voice, and personality

- **Name** - The AI's name
- **Appearance** - Either the AI's profile picture or live avatar option
- **Voice** - The voice model the AI uses (see the drop down menu at the top of each provider's tab to see price estimates)
- **Personality** - The AI's personality type, style of speaking, confidence, professionalism, assertiveness, etc.

<Warning>
  Do not include any background or situational context in the Persona. That belongs in the Background.
</Warning>

## AI Background

**Components:** There are only two fields for the AI background:

- **Title** - The AI's role and company
