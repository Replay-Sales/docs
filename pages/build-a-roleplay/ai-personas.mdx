There are two main parts of each AI bot: the persona and the background.

## AI Persona

**Overview:** The AI's name, appearance, voice, and personality

- **Name** - The AI's name
- **Appearance** - Either the AI's profile picture or live avatar option
- **Voice** - The voice model the AI uses (see the drop down menu at the top of each provider's tab to see price estimates)
- **Personality** - The AI's personality type, style of speaking, confidence, professionalism, assertiveness, etc.

<Warning>
  Do not include any background or situational context in the Persona. That belongs in the Background.
</Warning>

## AI Background

**Definition:** A general field that lets you input the AI's relevant situation, background, pains, needs, etc.

**Components:** There are only two fields for the AI background:

- **Title** - The AI's role and company
- **Situation/context** - Any relevant context to the situation. Common data included here for sales scenarios is:
  - Pain points/Specific needs
  - Budget/income level
  - Decision criteria
  - Decision makers
  - Competition knowledge

## Creating Variety

You can mix and match personas and backgrounds to create diverse training roleplays:

### Different Difficulty Levels

- **Easy**: "Always say yes"
- **Medium**: "Quiet, slightly stubborn, but able to be convinced"
- **Hard**: "Be rude, interrupt the user, etc."

### Different Buyer Types

- **Technical buyer**: Focuses on specifications and integration
- **Financial buyer**: Focuses on ROI and cost savings
- **End-user buyer**: Focuses on ease of use and features
