description: 'Create a subset of conversations; let your rep create their own roleplay'

<Note type="warning">
  Start screens are only available for companies who use a white labeled version of Replay, and can only be used inside of an LMS.
</Note>

## What is it?

Use a start screen activity to make a subset of conversations for your reps to choose from.

For example, if you teach multiple industries and have a course for each industry, you can create a start screen specific to each industry.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Example Use Case">
    i.e. learning to sell solar can have a start screen with solar specific conversations, while learning to sell pest control can have pest control specific start screens
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Use the preview button to see exactly what the rep will see when they launch the activity in your LMS
