## What is it?

A premade roleplay allows you to preselect exactly what you want your rep to do in a given roleplay. The building blocks approach makes it easy to create and reuse components across multiple roleplays.

## Creating Roleplays

When you create a new roleplay, you'll see several building blocks:

- Scenarios
- Scorecards
- Personas
- Situations
- Solutions
- Instructions

Each of these components can be:

- Created once and reused across multiple roleplays
- Mixed and matched to create different training scenarios
- Saved as templates for future use
