## What is it?

A premade roleplay allows you preselect exactly what you want your rep to do in a given roleplay.

When a rep launches the activity inside of Replay or in your LMS, they'll see relevant information and a start button.

<Note>
  Use the preview button to see exactly what the rep will see when they launch the activity in your LMS
</Note>

<Info>
  We'll send a completed / passed event to your LMS when a user achieves the score you set or higher!
