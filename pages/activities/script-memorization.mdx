title: 'Script Memorization'
description: 'Help your reps memorize a script through repetition and incremental deletion'
---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set the number of levels">
    Choose how many incremental steps your reps will take
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the passing score">
    Define the accuracy needed to progress
  </Step>

  <Step title="Learn the script!">
    Start memorizing through repetition
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How does it work?

You set the number of levels and percentage needed to pass

Replay will take away a percentage of words based on the current level the user is on

A rep will go through as many levels as you specify, until they have the script memorized!

<Note>
  This activity is exportable as a SCORM package ðŸŽ‰

- Create a script, use the share button to export the SCORM package, then upload it to your LMS!
- We'll send a completed / passed event to your LMS when a user finishes all levels
