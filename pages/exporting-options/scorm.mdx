## Good to Know

<Note>
  **Replay SCORM packages NEVER need to be updated.** Once you create an activity, export it as SCORM, then upload it to your LMS, you can feel free to continue updating it on Replay.

When your user launches the SCORM package, the SCORM package will automatically reach out to Replay to get the latest version of the activity.
