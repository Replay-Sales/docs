<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy the Iframe">
    Each activity requires a specific iframe configuration. Here's the base template:

    ```html
    <iframe
      id="replay-iframe"
      src="https://app.replay.sale/api/iframe/launch?activityId=403dded8-6a20-410d-a234-75c0f35f44f0&activityType=premade-roleplay&integrationJwt=<INPUT_INTEGRATION_JWT>"
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
      frameborder="0"
      border="none"
      allow="microphone; camera; clipboard-write; downloads; display-capture"
      style="position: absolute; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; top: 0;"
    ></iframe>
    ```

    <Accordion title="Do I have to copy the iframe every time? Or can I make it more dynamic?">
      __You do not need to copy the iframe every time.__ You are free to make it more dynamic by generating the iframe on your side, but in order to get the user into the correct activity, we will need the following:

      **src attributes:**
      * `a base url` (typically https://yourcompany.replay.sale)
      * `activityId` (the unique id of the activity you want to load)
      * `activityType` (the type of activity you want to load)
      * `integrationJwt` (a signed JWT that has the required claims. See step 2 for more details)

      **iframe attributes:**
      * `allow="microphone; camera; clipboard-write; downloads; display-capture"`
        * `microphone` and `camera` allow us to record the user
        * `clipboard-write` allows the user to copy a link to their roleplay analysis
        * `downloads` allows the user to download their audio / video recording
    </Accordion>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate a Signed JWT">
    You must generate a unique JWT for each user using your secret key. The JWT requires these claims:

    * `learnerName` - User's name (first, last, or both)
    * `uniqueIdentifier` - Your database's unique identifier for this user (UUID, email, etc.)
    * `originDomain` - Your company's domain identifier (see details below)

    <Accordion title="What is originDomain and how should I set it?">
      The `originDomain` is used to namespace users and prevent collisions between different companies or systems. Here's what you need to know:

      **Purpose**: If you use simple identifiers like `1`, `2`, `3` for users, and another company also uses `1`, `2`, `3`, we need a way to distinguish between "User 1 from Company A" and "User 1 from Company B".

      **How to set it**: 
      * Use your main company domain (e.g., `mycompany.com`, `microsoft.com`, `google.com`)
      * It does NOT need to match the actual domain where the iframe is hosted
      * Use the same value consistently for all users within your organization
      * For multi-tenant systems, you can use the same domain for all your customers

      **Examples**:
      * Single company: `"originDomain": "mycompany.com"`
      * Multi-tenant SaaS: `"originDomain": "mycompany.com"` (same for all customers)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Multi-Company Setup & Security">
      **If you manage multiple separate companies/clients:**

      Each company should have its own secret key for security. This ensures that:
      * Company A cannot access Company B's activities, even if they somehow obtain an iframe URL
      * Users are properly isolated between companies
      * Activity access is controlled at the company level

      **How it works:**
      * Each activity belongs to a specific company in Replay
      * The secret key you use to sign the JWT determines which company the user belongs to
      * When a user accesses an activity, we use the activity ID to look up which company owns it
      * We then validate the JWT signature against that company's secret key
      * Users can only access activities if their JWT was signed with the correct company's secret key

      **Setup Process:**
      1. Create separate child companies in Replay for each of your clients
      2. Get a unique secret key for each company
      3. Store and use the appropriate secret key when generating JWTs for each company's users

    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement the Integration">
    1. Generate the signed JWT for your user
    2. Replace `<INPUT_INTEGRATION_JWT>` in the iframe src with your signed JWT
    3. Load the iframe

    <Note>
      Best practice: Create a function that handles JWT generation and iframe src updates before loading
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Integration">
    Load your page and verify that:
    * The iframe loads successfully
    * User information is correct
    * Recording permissions work
    * Downloads function properly

      ```javascript Sign your own JWT
      // Your backend route should use a function like this to sign the JWT
      const signReplayJwt = () => {
        const uniqueIdentifier = "asdf1234"; // Replace with the actual unique identifier of your user
        const learnerName = "John Doe"; // Replace with your actual learner name
        const originDomain = "example.com"; // Replace with your domain (used for namespacing users)

        const payload = {
          uniqueIdentifier,
          learnerName,
          originDomain,
        };

        const secret = process.env.REPLAY_SECRET; // Replace with your actual secret that you got from Replay

        const integrationToken = jwt.sign(payload, secret, { expiresIn: "1h" });

        return integrationToken;
      };

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How do I handle multiple companies/clients in my system?">
  **Each company should be set up as a separate entity in Replay with its own secret key.**

  **Setup process:**
  1. Contact us to create child companies for each of your clients
  2. Get a unique secret key for each company
  3. Store the appropriate secret key for each company in your system
  4. Use the correct secret key when generating JWTs for users belonging to that company

  **Security:** This ensures that users from Company A cannot access Company B's activities, even if they somehow obtain an iframe URL from Company B.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What should I use for originDomain in a multi-tenant system?">
  **Use the same domain for all your customers** (e.g., `"mycompany.com"`).

  The `originDomain` is for namespacing users between different systems, not between customers. Since all your customers' users are coming through your system, they should all use the same `originDomain`.

  **Company separation is handled by:**
  - Using different secret keys for each company
  - Each activity belonging to a specific company in Replay
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can users access activities from other companies?">
  **No, if set up correctly.** 

  Here's exactly how the security validation works:
  1. When a user accesses an activity, we use the activity ID from the iframe URL to look up which company owns that activity
  2. We then validate the JWT signature against that specific company's secret key
  3. If the JWT wasn't signed with the correct company's secret key, access is denied

  This means even if a user somehow gets an iframe URL for a different company's activity, they won't be able to access it because their JWT was signed with their own company's secret key, not the target company's secret key.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need different originDomain values for different customers?">
  **No.** The `originDomain` is used to distinguish between different integration systems (e.g., "Microsoft vs Google"), not between customers within the same system.

  If you're managing multiple customers through your platform, use the same `originDomain` for all of them. Company separation is handled through different secret keys and the activity ownership system.
</Accordion>

## Message Passing

After the user completes the roleplay, the iframe will send messages to the parent window containing information about the user's performance and progress. To receive these messages, you'll need to set up an event listener in your parent window.

### Setting Up the Listener

Add this code to your parent window to receive messages from the Replay iframe:

```typescript
window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
    // Only accept messages from your Replay domain
    if (event.origin !== 'https://app.replay.sale') return;

    console.log('Received message from iframe:', event.data);

    if (event.data.type === 'roleplay_result') {
        console.log('Score:', event.data.score);
        console.log('Full result:', event.data.result);
    }
});
```

### When do we pass the message?

The message will be passed when the "Analysis" page is loaded for a roleplay that has been completed within the past 1 minute.

### Message Interface

<Note>
  The message type will always be "roleplay_result" and will contain both the overall score and the complete result object.
</Note>

<IframeRoleplayResultInterface />
