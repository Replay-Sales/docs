    <Warning>
      We recommend you enable "Use SCORM Completion Rules"
    </Warning>

    **If disabled** - LearnWorlds will mark the course as complete as soon as the rep opens the SCORM file.

    **When enabled** - Replay will determine if the rep has satisfied the requirements (i.e. achieved 70% or higher on a roleplay, finished all script memorization levels, etc.) and will report success to the LMS.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and preview!">
    Feel free to edit anything else on the creation page (title, description, icon, background image, etc).

    When finished, you can now save and preview your SCORM course!
