<Note>
Each webhook URL that you put into Replay is specific to the premade roleplay where you input it.

If you have multiple premade roleplays that should all use the same Zap, you'll need to follow steps 1 & 3 for each roleplay, all using the same webhook URL from Zapier.

</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="On Replay">
    1. Go to the Premade Roleplay you are using as a Lead Gen tool
    2. At the top right, click the ellipsis -> export
    3. In the modal that pops up, go to the Lead Gen (Demo) tab
    4. Make sure you have the correct Host URL set to avoid getting errors. [More information can be found here](/free-tools/lead-gen-tool#troubleshooting)
    5. Switch the tab to Zapier - Send Leads to your CRM. We'll come back here after doing some configuration on Zapier
  </Step>

<Step title="On Zapier">
  1. Create a new Zap 2. Add a Webhook component that uses a catch hook event 3.
  On the Test tab, copy the webhook URL that Zapier generates for you 4. Head
  back to Replay
</Step>

<Step title="Back on Replay">
  1. Paste the Webhook URL from Zapier into the Webhook URL box on Replay 2.
  Make sure to save! 3. Click Test to send a contact with test information to
  Zapier
</Step>

  <Step title="Back to Zapier">
    1. Still on the Test tab, click Find New Records
    2. You should now see a record containing the test contact information from Replay!
    3. Next, add a component to your Zap to send the information to your CRM
    4. Make sure to use a Create or Update event from your CRM

    For example, if you use HubSpot, your Zap should look like the image below:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/hubspot-zap-example.png" alt="Example of HubSpot Zap configuration" />
    </Frame>

    5. Inside of your CRM's component, go to the Action tab and map the values from Replay to the values you want in your CRM
    6. Publish your Zap! Once it's published, Replay will send information for anyone who fills out the form on your Lead Gen roleplay to Zapier, and from Zapier to your CRM!
