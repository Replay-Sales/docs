## Accessing Settings

Navigate to `Replay > Company Settings` to customize your instance.

<Note>
  Company settings are only available on white-labeled versions of Replay (typically accessed via yourcompany.replay.sale)

## Branding Options

We have two branding options:

- **Partial White Labeling** - Your company logo, favicon, and colors will be used. Replay will occasionally display logos or a "Powered by Replay" watermark.
- **Full White Labeling** - Your company logo, favicon, and colors will be used. Replay will not display any logos or watermarks.
