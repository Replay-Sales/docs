## How do I use Scenarios?

Real life conversations can be LONG, and usually reps don't need to roleplay an entire conversation.

At Replay, we encourage reps to roleplay the portion of the conversation that is relevant to what they are learning, that way they can focus on the skill they are learning, rather than focusing on roleplaying a drawn-out conversation.

In Replay, you'll see that Scenario Folders are made of Scenarios, which are the various points within a conversation a rep will practice.

Let's look at a few examples:

| Scenario Folder | Scenario 1           | Scenario 2      | Scenario 3      |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Door Approach   | Break Pre-Occupation | Set the Meeting |                 |
| Virtual Setting | Intro                | Qualifying      | Set the Meeting |
| Virtual Closing | Discovery            | Demo            | Next Steps      |

<Note>
  You'll notice that scenarios flow sequentially, just as the conversation
  typically does, but lets the rep focus on just one part at a time.

## Customers, responses, and scorecards are all tied to scenarios

Think about it. If you are cold calling someone, you might get a very wide range of customer types who answer the phone. They might be nice, or they could just want you out of their hair.

However, if you are on a closing call with someone and have been speaking to them for the past 30 minutes, they probably won't be giving quick responses to get you to bug off.

The same could be said about responses. A customer at the beginning of a cold call might try to brush off a rep with an "I'm busy" smokescreen, but that typically wouldn't happen when talking next steps.

<Info>
  In Replay, you get to decide which customers, responses, and scorecards go to
  which scenario. By doing so, you'll make sure your reps get a realistic
  roleplay experience, based on where they are in the conversation.
