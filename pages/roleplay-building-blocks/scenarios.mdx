## Building Scenarios

A scenario consists of three main components:

### 1. AI Context

This tells the AI what has happened up until this point in the conversation. Examples:

- **Cold Call**: "_You got a call from an unknown number and picked up_"
- **Mid-Sales Conversation**: "_You've had a 30-minute conversation about the product, and the rep has asked if you're willing to move forward_"

<Note>
  Important: The AI context should NOT include:
  - Customer-specific information (this goes in the customer situation)
  - Product details (this goes in the solutions building block)
</Note>

### 2. AI Instructions

These are specific instructions for how the AI should behave in this type of conversation:

- **Cold Call Example**: AI gives more frequent objections and is less receptive
- **Discovery Call Example**: AI is more open to answering questions and engaging

### 3. Opening Line

The conversation starter, which can be:

- Sound-based starts:
  - Outbound phone
  - Inbound phone
  - Door knock
- Mid-conversation starts:
  - Specific dialogue line
  - Continuation from a previous point
