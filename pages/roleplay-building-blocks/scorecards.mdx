## How do I use scorecards?

Customize the feedback that is given after a roleplay by using a scorecard.

A scorecard is a collection of AI prompts or paraverbal metrics that judge whether a rep successfully completed a task or used a skill.

You get to choose the prompts that go into a scorecard. Then, you can assign a weight to each prompt. The analysis will take these weights into account in order to create the final score.
