## How do I use prompts?

Customize the feedback a rep receives after doing a roleplay by creating skill prompts.

A skill prompt is an AI prompt that judge whether a rep successfully completed a task or used a skill.

## Types of Prompts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Multi Select Question">
    Provide various options. The rep will receive a pass/fail for every option
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Ended Question">
    A very general prompt to answer a general question
    
    <Note>
      Will not be used to calculate the final score
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Range Question">
    A ranking (1-10) of how well a rep accomplished a specific task
  </Step>

  <Step title="Single Select Question">
    Provide various options. If a rep accomplishes any of the options, they'll get a pass
  </Step>

  <Step title="Yes / No Question">
    A simple pass / fail for if a rep accomplished a specific task
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Where to Use Prompts

Skill prompts can go into two places:

1. A [scorecard](/roleplay-building-blocks/scorecards)
2. A premade [roleplay](/activities/premade-roleplays)

<Note>
  Once you assign a prompt to a scorecard or a premade roleplay, you can assign a weight to it. Weights must add up to equal 100% and will be taken into account when giving a rep their final score.
