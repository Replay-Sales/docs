## How do I use customers?

There is a wide range of customer types that a rep might face. They might be easy-going, might need some convincing, or might be difficult and demanding. Each customer type requires a unique approach to ensure their needs are met and they have a positive experience.

You can simulate these customer types in Replay by creating a customer.

## AI Components for Creating Customers

### Personality: How should this customer respond to your rep?

<CodeGroup>
  ```text:Example 1
  You are generally happy and aim to answer all the rep's questions.
  ```
  ```text:Example 2
  You are getting annoyed with sales reps constantly calling you.
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Pain Points: Does the customer have any pain points that your product would help with?

<CodeGroup>
  ```text:Example 1 
  You have been struggling with an extremely burdensome hiring process and are looking for a solution. 
  ``` 
  ```text:Example 2
  You do your bookkeeping manually, and this is taking up too much time.
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Additional Context: Is there any other relevant information that doesn't fit into our other fields?

<CodeGroup>
  ```text:Example 1

  ```
  ```text:Example 2
