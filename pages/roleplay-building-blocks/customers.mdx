## Customer Components

The customer building block consists of two main parts: **Personas** and **Situations**.

<Note type="warning">
  Important: When writing for the AI, speak to it directly as if you're training it to be a customer.
  
  Examples:
  - "You are..."
  - "You will..."
  - "You have been looking for..."
</Note>

### 1. Customer Personas

Personas define the AI's appearance and personality:

- **Appearance Settings**

  - **Profile picture**: Choose an avatar that matches your target customer demographic
  - **Name**: Give your persona a realistic name
  - **Age**: Set an appropriate age for your target customer
  - **Voice**: Choose from our library of AI voices to match the persona

- **Personality Traits**
  - **Confidence level**: From hesitant ("_You are unsure about making changes to your current system_") to very confident ("_You know exactly what features you need_")
  - **Knowledge level**: From novice ("_You have never used this type of software before_") to expert ("_You have researched all our competitors_")
  - **Detail orientation**: From big picture ("_You want to focus on overall impact_") to detail-focused ("_You need specific data about implementation timelines_")
  - **Assertiveness**: From passive ("_You prefer to let the rep guide the conversation_") to demanding ("_You need concrete answers about pricing_")
  - **Professionalism**: From casual ("_You prefer informal conversations_") to formal ("_You expect professional business interactions_")
  - **Difficulty level**:
    - **Easy**: "_You are excited to learn about our solution_"
    - **Medium**: "_You have several concerns that need to be addressed_"
    - **Hard**: "_You are skeptical of our claims and need proof_"

### 2. Customer Situations

Situations define the business context and needs:

- **Company Details**

  - **Job title**: Position and level of authority (e.g., "_VP of Sales_", "_HR Manager_")
  - **Company name**: Can be real or fictional
  - **Company size/revenue**: Helps determine budget and scale of needs
  - **Industry**: Affects pain points and solution requirements

- **Business Context**
  - **Pain points**: Specific problems you're facing
    - "_You are frustrated that your team spends 4 hours per day on data entry_"
    - "_You are losing 30% of customers due to slow response times_"
  - **Specific needs**: What you're looking for
    - "_You need integration with your existing CRM_"
    - "_You require support for multiple languages_"
  - **Current challenges**: Your business issues
    - "_You are growing too fast to maintain quality_"
    - "_You have high employee turnover in customer service_"
  - **Business goals**: What you want to achieve
    - "_You need to increase sales efficiency by 25%_"
    - "_You want to reduce customer churn by 50%_"

## Creating Variety

You can mix and match personas and situations with premade roleplays to create diverse training roleplays:

- **Different Difficulty Levels**

  - **Easy**: "_You have heard great things about our solution_"
  - **Medium**: "_You are currently comparing several vendors_"
  - **Hard**: "_You have a better offer from our competitor_"

- **Different Buyer Types**
  - **Technical buyer**: Focuses on specifications and integration
  - **Financial buyer**: Focuses on ROI and cost savings
  - **End-user buyer**: Focuses on ease of use and features
