## How do I use responses?

You can force the customer to give an objection, or say something specific, by using a response.

This could be a smokescreen, objection, or just a phrase you want the customer to say.

## Components of a Response

<Steps>
  <Step title="AI Prompt: Tell the AI exactly how/what you want them to say">
    - This should be in 3rd person, and you should address the AI as "you"
    - Replay will force you to start with "Respond by...". We've found this starting phrase produces the best responses
  </Step>

  <Step title="Example(s) of Response in the Customer's Voice">
    - Give a few examples of how your typical customer might bring up this objection
    - You can think of this as the inverse of the AI prompt
    - The AI will use these as a base to create its own, unique response
  </Step>

  <Step title="Best Responses from Rep">
    How should your rep overcome the objection?
    - Use this field if you have specific responses your rep should give every time to overcome this objection
    - This field is not required
    - After a roleplay, the rep will receive a report detailing if they used the best response or not
  </Step>

    Use capital letters to emphasize a point.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```text:Example
    YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A NEW SOLUTION FOR YOUR MANUAL BOOKKEEPING PROCESS
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    If that still doesn't work, wrap the phrase in ###.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```text:Example
    ### YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A NEW SOLUTION FOR YOUR MANUAL BOOKKEEPING PROCESS ###
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    The stronger your wording, the better the AI understands it. Avoid using passive language; use explicit language that very clearly defines what you want the AI to do.
