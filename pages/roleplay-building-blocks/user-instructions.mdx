The User Instructions block is the final component displayed to users before they begin the conversation. These instructions are crucial for setting up the context and expectations for the roleplay interaction.

## Key Components

The User Instructions should include three main elements:

### 1. Conversation Context

- Provide background information about what has happened up until this point
- Include what the representative would already know about the prospect
- Set the scene for where the conversation is picking up

### 2. Goal/Desired Outcome

- Clearly state what the objective of the conversation is
- Specify what success looks like (e.g., getting the customer to agree to buy your product)
- Define what actions or commitments you want to achieve by the end of the interaction

### 3. Scoring Reference

- Explain how the user will be evaluated
- Reference specific elements from the scorecard
- Highlight the key areas they need to focus on to pass the activity

## Best Practices

- Keep instructions clear and concise
- Ensure all three components are covered
- Provide enough context without overwhelming the user
